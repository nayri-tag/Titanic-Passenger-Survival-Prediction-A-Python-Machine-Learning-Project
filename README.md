# Titanic-Passenger-Survival-Prediction-A-Python-Machine-Learning-Project

Developed a predictive model for the Titanic dataset using Python and libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Keras, and TensorFlow.

Conducted data cleaning and preprocessing, handled missing values, dropped irrelevant columns, and converted categorical variables to numerical representations.

Implemented and compared an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Logistic Regression model, achieving 78.36% and 82.09% accuracy on the test set. Evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
